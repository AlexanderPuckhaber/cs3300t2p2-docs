##  Quality Control

### Feature and Bug Tracking
We planned to utilize a Google Sheets file that we all have access to via Google Drive to track bugs and enhancement requests. 
Instead, we used GitHub Issues to track feature and enhancement requests, and made new branches for each feature. 
For bug tracking, we mostly debugged our own features, although we sent extensive communications with each other through Discord to share information about bugs and help collaborate on debugging them.
